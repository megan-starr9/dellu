                <p class='welcome'>The capitol was the place that every child dreamed to visit. The amount of things to do there was endless. The scientists would show off their technology as if it were market day. They thought themselves better than the rest. The adults knew that they would become the downfall of soceity and stayed away. After that fateful day of the sighting of Telgar, the scientists went silent. The capitol became just like any other city. The people began to worry. Then the portal appeared, and all hell broke loose. Electronics began to fail near the veil, then the outer cities, then around the world. No longer were the scientists looked upon with awe, but with scorn. They had failed the humans by disregarding the world and all that lived in it. As if the winds themselves sighed, the Druids appeared to set things right. They gathered people to take care of the world and to save the wildlife. The hated capital once again became teeming with people. People who cared and prayed that the world would once again become a better place.</p>
